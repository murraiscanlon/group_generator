Problem statement:
    In my class, the students works in groups or partnerships most of the time. I spend too much time trying to
    form random groups. I need a program that can quickly form groups of specified sizes from my class rosters.

Ask the user for a filename to get all up-to-date rosters
Read in the data and load it to Student objects
