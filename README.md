##  PURPOSE: ![img of application](https://github.com/murraiscanlon/group-project-calculator/blob/master/light-bulb32.png)
Rather than spending time creating student groups from scratch, this program will generate random groups based on class rosters
and a specified group size provided by the user.

##  HOW TO USE: ![img_of_application] (https://github.com/murraiscanlon/group_generator/blob/master/images/play.png)

Compile/Run
Note: Report will be saved in the output folder as a .txt file

* Create destination on user's desktop for output report
* Validate input in projectDetails() function
* Look into changing menu switch statement to classes<br /><br /><br />
